**Nextcloud desktop client with built-in Kill Switch anti-ransomware protection.**

> *"The fire crackles. Your files are protected."*

---

## Project Status

> **This project is currently in early development (prototype stage).**

We're building something new: a Nextcloud sync client that fights back against ransomware. This isn't a finished product yet - it's a working prototype that demonstrates our vision.

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Core Kill Switch engine | ✅ Complete |
| Threat detectors (4 types) | ✅ Complete |
| Desktop UI (Settings + Alerts) | ✅ Complete |
| Test suite (81 tests) | ✅ Complete |
| Windows build pipeline | ✅ Complete |
| Linux build pipeline | ✅ Complete |
| Android client | ⏳ Planned |
| macOS native build | ⏳ Planned |
| Production release | ⏳ Planned |

### What Works Today

- **Kill Switch detection** - Mass deletions, entropy analysis, pattern matching, canary files
- **Automatic sync pause** - Stops damage before it spreads
- **Threat dashboard** - Visual monitoring of security events
- **Configuration presets** - Light, Standard, Paranoid modes

### What's Coming

- Pre-built installers for Windows/macOS/Linux
- Android app with Kill Switch protection
- Cloud-based threat intelligence
- Enterprise management console

---

## The Vision

Ransomware doesn't care about your backups if it encrypts them before they sync.

Traditional sync clients are **dumb pipes** - they faithfully replicate whatever happens locally, including disasters. We believe sync clients should be **smart guardians** that recognize threats and protect your data.

**Sentinel is our answer:** a sync client that watches for suspicious patterns and hits the brakes before catastrophe strikes.

## What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is a security-enhanced fork of the [Nextcloud Desktop Client](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop) that adds **proactive ransomware protection** through an intelligent Kill Switch system.

When suspicious activity is detected (mass deletions, file encryption patterns, canary file tampering), Sentinel **automatically pauses sync** to prevent damage from spreading to your Nextcloud server.

---

## Key Features

### Kill Switch Protection

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mass Delete Detection** | Triggers when too many files are deleted in a short time window |
| **Entropy Analysis** | Detects encrypted/ransomware files by analyzing file entropy patterns |
| **Pattern Detection** | Recognizes 80+ known ransomware file extensions (.locked, .encrypted, .cry, etc.) |
| **Canary Files** | Monitors honeypot files - if they're touched, something's wrong |
| **Automatic Backup** | Creates safety snapshots before suspicious operations |

### Threat Dashboard

- Real-time threat level indicator
- History of detected threats with timestamps
- Configurable sensitivity presets (Light / Standard / Paranoid)
- One-click sync resume after false positives

---

## Why Sentinel?

| Scenario | Standard Client | Sentinel |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Ransomware encrypts 1000 files | All synced to server | **Blocked after ~10 files** |
| Accidental mass delete | Synced immediately | **Paused for confirmation** |
| Suspicious file patterns | No detection | **Alert + auto-pause** |
| Recovery options | Restore from server | **Local backup + server intact** |

---

## Try It Yourself

> **Note:** This is prototype software. Use at your own risk and always maintain separate backups.

### Build from Source

#### Windows (Quick Start)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jlacerte/nextcloud-sentinel.git
cd nextcloud-sentinel

# Run the setup script
.\CLICK-ME-FIRST.bat
```

#### Linux (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlacerte/nextcloud-sentinel.git
cd nextcloud-sentinel

# Build using Docker
./build-wsl.sh --docker
```

#### Full Build Instructions

See [SENTINEL-BUILD-PLAN.md](SENTINEL-BUILD-PLAN.md) for detailed build instructions.

## Configuration

### Kill Switch Settings

Access via: **Settings > Kill Switch**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Delete Threshold | 10 files | Max deletions before trigger |
| Time Window | 60 seconds | Monitoring window |
| Entropy Threshold | 7.5 | Shannon entropy limit (max 8.0) |
| Auto-Backup | Enabled | Backup before suspicious ops |

### Presets

- **Light**: Higher thresholds, fewer false positives
- **Standard**: Balanced protection (recommended)
- **Paranoid**: Maximum security, may have more alerts

## Testing

```bash
# Run Kill Switch tests
cd build && ctest -R KillSwitch --output-on-failure
```

**Test coverage:** 81 tests covering:
- False positive scenarios
- Edge cases (empty files, long paths, unicode)
- Thread safety
- Cache and timing
